## 🧩 Overview

This repository contains the **charging test data of 10 electric vehicles (EVs)** used in the above publication.
The dataset supports research on **rapid state-of-health (SOH) estimation** of in-service lithium-ion battery packs using **short-time charging data** and **domain adaptation-based transfer learning**.

The dataset can be used to:

* Reproduce the experiments and figures presented in the paper;
* Train and validate deep learning or machine learning models for SOH estimation;
* Develop and benchmark domain adaptation and transfer learning strategies for battery data.

## 🧠 How to Use

1. **Feature Extraction**

   * Extract short voltage–capacity segments (ΔV = 100 mV recommended) from the charging data.
   * Compute **incremental capacity sequences (ΔQ)** for both maximum and mean cell voltages.

2. **Model Training**

   * Use synthetic data (from digital twin simulation) for pre-training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN).
   * Apply **transfer learning** or **domain adaptation** with these real vehicle datasets for fine-tuning.

3. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between estimated and measured SOH.
   * Typical result: MAE ≈ 3.2%, RMSE ≈ 3.9% using DCNN with domain adaptation.
